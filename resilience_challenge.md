# Resilience Challange

Goal: run a workload while disrupting cluster nodes

## Get your cluster ID:

You will need to get your cluster id to use the tool. In your cluster page, go to `Actions`, `Get Suppport` options and copy the `Cluster Support ID` value:

## Cluster disruption tool

Use the self-service disruption tool to take nodes down (open is a new tab):  

[Open cluster disruption tool](http://18.119.119.45:5000/)

Once in the tool, paste the cluster ID you copied before and click `Submit`:

Once in the tool, this is how it works:  
- `Disrupt` button on the Cluster Nodes table to take one node down at time.
- `Restore All Nodes` button to restore all nodes.

## Run the Go Application

There is a Go Application already loaded in Instuqt. This applicaiton manages Transactions, so when a nodes is down, the application skips the failed operation, avoiding the whole application to fail.  

In Instruqt, go the the `Application` tab, and on the left-hand side, click on the file `main.go`. The code will open on the center panel editor.  You don't need to make changes, this is just for your reference.  

To execute the application, go back to the `_Terminal` tab in Instruqt and run the following commands:  

Change to the directory where the actually application is loaded:  
```
cd go_application
```

Run the Go application. Change <YOUR_CLUSTER_DNS> value for your actual cluster DNS:  
```
go run main.go -url "postgresql://craig:cockroach@<YOUR_CLUSTER_DNS>:26257/defaultdb"
```

You will start to see something like this:  

```
7557d3d6 -> 6a59f6b9 took 440ms
c4a15fab -> 66175acf took 191ms
71cf7285 -> e087576b took 188ms
b681fb41 -> fe2259dd took 200ms
847b3986 -> 0fd897c8 took 198ms
```

The Go application will create a table called `account` in `defaultdb` database with some initial recods, and randomly will transfer money from one account to other.  

Now it is time to see and play with Resilience.  

ðŸ’¡ Take any node down while running the Go application.   
ðŸ’¡ If the node down, run a simple SELECT query (SELECT * FROM default.account LIMIT 50;) and see if it returns records.   
ðŸ’¡ Use the DB Console -> Overview to see the alters listed when the node is down.
