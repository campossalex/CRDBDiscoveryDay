You will need to get your cluster id to use the tool. In your cluster page, go to `Actions`, `Get Suppport` options and copy the `Cluster Support ID` value:

Once in the tool, use the `Disrupt` button on the Cluster Nodes table to take one node down at time. To restore all nodes, use the `Restore All Nodes` button located below the table.

ðŸ’¡ Take any node down, run a simple SELECT query (SELECT * FROM movr.rides LIMIT 50;) and see if it returns records.   
ðŸ’¡ Use the DB Console -> Overview to see the alters listed when the node is down.
