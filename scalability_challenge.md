# Scalability Challange

Goal: run a workload while scaling up the cluster


## Run a workload  

CockroachDB binaries includes samples workloads to facilitates benchmarking and stress tests. To see how the databases behaviors during a scale up operation, run the `bank` workload. 
Copy the command and paste it in the `_Terminal` tab in Instruqt. Replace the <YOUR_CLUSTER_DNS> value:  

```
cockroach workload run bank --duration 15m --drop "postgresql://craig:cockroach@<YOUR_CLUSTER_DNS>:26257" --method simple_protocol --min-conns 500
```

After the inital table creation and data is loaded, you will see an output similar to the following one:  

```

## Scale up the Cluster

Your cluster is configured with one node. This is not a recommended configuration for production clusters, 
but for the propurse of this workshop, this setup is ok to demostrate how fast and easy a cluster can scale up.  

Go to the your cluster in the Cockroach Cloud console. Make sure you are in the `Overview` section. You should see a page like this:  

In the Overview page, click on the `pencil` icon you can see in the `Region` section. This will open a new page to edit the cluster configuration.


In the `Nodes` dropmenu option, select 3 value. This will add two more nodes to your cluster. 

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not add a new Region. Just change from 1 to 3 the Nodes value.

On the right-hand side, click on `Next: Capacity` button and move to the Capacity section.

Do not make any changes on the Capacity section, click on `Update Cluster` to finsh the scale up configuration. So easy, right?

Now the cluster will be in the process to add the two additional nodes. You can on the Overview page the two nodes being added.

üí° Use the DB Console to monitor the scale up process.  
üí° Check the workload you are running in `_Terminal` and observe if the workload was stopped while scaling up the cluster.
